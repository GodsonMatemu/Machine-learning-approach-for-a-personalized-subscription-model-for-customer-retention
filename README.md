# Machine-learning-approach-for-a-personalized-subscription-model-for-customer-retention( Divvy Cyclist Chicago)

Aim of the Project

The study aims to improve customer loyalty by designing a machine-learning model that 
segments customers based on individual purchasing behaviour. Furthermore, the resultant customer segments are specified with appropriate subscription prices which are dynamic according to the changing customer behaviour. 
According to Ganaie & Bhat, (2021) switching barriers, which are tools used by service providers to persuade a consumer to buy from them repeatedly, are considered one of the factors that have a significant impact on customer loyalty.
This novel churn prevention strategy integrates switching barriers by not only implementing loyalty programs such as rewards and discounts but also a subscription model that will motivate a customer to continue the existing relationship with the provider for a month. In addition, the subscription price is personalized through customer segmentation and the met the required customer satisfaction to improve loyalty.

Objectives of the Study

1.	To identify characteristics and techniques for customer segmentation and clustering.
2.	To identify and develop customer segments using clustering techniques
3.	To design and develop a model that predicts a personalized subscription price using an effective machine learning technique.
